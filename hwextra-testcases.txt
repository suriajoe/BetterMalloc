Test cases:

test0:
    General test. Calls malloc 4 times and check to make sure data
    is properly stored. Then frees all allocated memory and checks
    for an errors. Works if no errors are printed.

test1:
    Attempt to free a pointer twice. Starts by allocating memory
    and then tries to free pointer to allocated memory twice. prints
    error message upons second call of free.

test2:
    Attempt to free an un-allocated pointer. Creates an integer i and
    passed address of i to free. Because this address is not within
    the static char array, it will print an error.

test3:
    Attempt to free a bad pointer. Starts by allocating memory and then
    adds 5 to the pointer. Because this is a bad pointer, free prints
    an error message.

test4:
    Attempt to allocate too much memory. Simple test case that attempts
    to allocate 5000 bytes of memory. Because this is the size of the
    char array, it can not fit inside and will print error message.
